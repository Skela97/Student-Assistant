University Obligations Assistance Project
Welcome to the University Obligations Assistance Project! This project is designed to help university students manage their academic obligations effectively through a client-server application.

Overview
The project consists of three main components:

Server: This handles the backend logic endpoints.
Client: This is the frontend application that students will interact with.
Common: Contains shared code and utilities used by both the server and client.

Additionally, we provide an initdb.sql file to set up the project's database schema and populate it with initial data.
